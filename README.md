# http-caching-proxy

This project is about a http-caching-proxy - a server whose job it is to forward requests to the origin server on behalf of the client. 
Our proxy can cache responses, and, when appropriate, respond with the cached copy of a resource rather than re-fetching it.

How to run this project:
type sudo docker-compose build in your terminal. After seeing the success message, type sudo docker-compose up in your terminal.
